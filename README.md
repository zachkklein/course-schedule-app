### Our Project

An improved course audit for Tufts students. Users will be able to see their degree progress in a more streamlined and simpiler way.
Our goal was to make it easier for students to see what courses they need to take for their major and plan out their future semester. 
This weekend, we just scratched the surface by fully implementing our site for CS majors in the School of Engineereing but have planned out
a hopeful design for the future which includes all Majors.

### Reflection

1. Our team chose this project because coming from a group of different majors and years, we were all confused looking at the Tufts degree audit and knew that there needed to be a change. We have major plans for our website going into the future. Mainly, we want to expand for all schools and majors at Tufts, allowing access for all students. 
2. A tricky issue we had during the development of our website was scraping the course data off Tufts webpages. To overcome this, we wrote
Python scripts that turned plain text info into JSON files that our program was able to interact with.
3. Our team ate all of our meals together over the weekend which was a great bonding experience as we formed at the start of the Hackathon. We also went to the seminars together to learn and apply the knowledge to our project
